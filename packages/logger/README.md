```

**success**: Use `success` to assert to users that their instructions have completed successfully.

### Silencing Messages In Tests

Use the `@cosm-changesets/test-utils` package to silence the logs in test cases.

For example:

```js
import { temporarilySilenceLogs } from "@cosm-changesets/test-utils";
import { log } from "@cosm-changesets/logger";

temporarilySilenceLogs();

// Now the logs in this test file are not actually logged to std out
log("I am not logged");

// Use console.log to log messages in tests if required
console.log("Yiey, I am logged");
```
